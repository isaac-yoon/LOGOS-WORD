              Whether you're a devout believer or a critical skeptic, it is undeniable that the Bible has influenced Western civilization.
              The Bible has been around for at least 2000 years, a time period that most of us cannot begin to imagine. Google has only been around for 20!
              Not to mention, year by year, decade by decade, the Bible is the #1 bestseller by such a wide margin that the New York Times bestseller list omits it. But why is it so popular?
              See for yourself as you take this journey through some curated verses.
